# Water Frog
You're a frog.. but you're dissolvable with water. huh, i guess you must be made out of sugar. Well, you better start jumping cuz you can't seem to stop running.
This is a 2D game where you jump over puddles of water to stop yourself from dissolving and obtain a high score, although you're constantly accelerating forward. Made in Godot with GDScript. why? why not i ask you. why not.
